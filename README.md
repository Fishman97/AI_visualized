# ML Visualization

This project provides a collection of some vibecoded visualizations for machine learning concepts using Jupyter notebooks.

## Setup Instructions

### 0. Install Conda and Jupyter

If you don't have Conda, download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for your operating system.

Jupyter will be installed automatically with the requirements below, but you can also install it via Conda:

```bash
conda install jupyter
```

### 1. Create and Activate Conda Environment

First, create a new Conda environment and activate it.

```bash
conda create --name ai-viz python=3.13
conda activate ai-viz
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Jupyter Notebook

Finally, launch the Jupyter notebook with CLI command or with VSCode or PyCharm.

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_visualization.ipynb
```
